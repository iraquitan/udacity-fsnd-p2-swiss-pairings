# PROJECT 2 - Swiss Pairings Tournament
This project provides code to store players and matches in database and provide functions to do swiss pairings. This project has two branches. The master branch implements only the basic asked in the descriptions of the project. The other branch is extras, and implements almost all items in the extra credit section of the project description.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Git
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

## Quick start
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/iraquitan/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git`.
* Change directory to the `vagrant/` directory inside the previously cloned repo.
* To run this project with extra credits, run:
    - `git checkout extras`
    - Extra credits includes:
    - Prevent rematches between players.
    - Don’t assume an even number of players. If there is an odd number of players, assign one player a “bye” (skipped round). A bye counts as a free win. A player should not receive more than one bye in a tournament.
    - When two players have the same number of wins, rank them according to OMW (Opponent Match Wins), the total number of wins by players they have played against.
    - Support more than one tournament in the database, so matches do not have to be deleted between tournaments. This will require distinguishing between “a registered player” and “a player who has entered in tournament #123”, so it will require changes to the database schema.
 * Run the following code on terminal: `vagrant up` to setup virtual machine.
 * Run the following code on terminal: `vagrant ssh` to connect to the virtual machine using ssh.
 * Run the following code on terminal: `cd /vagrant/tournament/` to change directory to this project. * Run the following code on terminal: `dropdb --if-exists tournament` to drop tournament database if already exists.
 * Run the following code on terminal: `createdb tournament` to create tournament database.
 * Run the following code on terminal: `psql tournament -f /vagrant/tournament/tournament.sql` to feed the tournament database with tables and rules in the tournament.sql file.
 * To test, run the following on terminal: `python /vagrant/tournament/tournament_test.py`.
